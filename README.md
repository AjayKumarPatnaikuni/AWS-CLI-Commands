# AWS-CLI-Commands
This repo has  useful commands for any AWS CLI user.


The Bash+CLI folder has some powerful scripts that combine the features of Linux Bash and AWS CLI which let you do some cool things.

####First example:
 you could quickly provision an EC2 by calling an script like this:
``` ./runInstanceDefaultVPC

 ``` 

And you have an instance running!!
Remember to make the file executable and to rename the key to that you own.

####Second Example:
You can combine bash+CLU to describe tags for all your Elastic Load Balancers on a certain region.
You can find this script under Bash+CLI/ELB/
